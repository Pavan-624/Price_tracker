📝 Abstract
The Movie Recommender System is designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. Using the cosine similarity algorithm, the system calculates similarity scores between movie vectors and generates recommendations. The project covers:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Preparing and cleaning data for analysis.

Feature Extraction and Vectorization: Transforming movie attributes into vectors.

Similarity Calculation: Identifying similar movies based on user preferences.

Web Integration: Deploying a user-friendly interface for interaction.

🌟 Project Overview
Recommender systems are widely used across industries like e-commerce and OTT platforms to enhance user experiences.

Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes movie attributes (genre, director, actors) for recommendations.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies by examining user-to-user and item-to-item relationships.

Hybrid Filtering: Combines both approaches for better accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of these techniques with a focus on cosine similarity.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares datasets for analysis.

Vectorization: Transforms movie data into vectors for similarity measurement.

Cosine Similarity Algorithm: Calculates the angle between vectors to measure similarity.

Top 5 Recommendations: Suggests the most similar movies based on user input.

Web-Based Interface: Simplifies user interactions with a friendly UI.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Algorithm: Cosine Similarity

Deployment Framework: Flask

📈 Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Collect movie datasets from APIs or CSV files.

Handle missing values, duplicates, and format inconsistencies.

Feature Extraction and Vectorization: Extract attributes like genre, ratings, and cast. Convert them into feature vectors.

Cosine Similarity Implementation: Compute similarity scores between movie vectors. Identify top recommendations based on similarity.

5.Web Deployment: Develop a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.

✔️ Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages

Efficiency: Handles high-dimensional and sparse data effectively.

Personalization: Delivers user-specific recommendations.

Simplicity: Easy to implement and interpret.

Disadvantages

Data Dependency: Requires high-quality datasets for accuracy.

No Negative Correlations: Does not account for negative attribute relationships.

Vector Length Bias: Can be influenced by vector magnitude.
